A simple app to learn how to create fullstack project.

This project consists of two parts:

- teamfinder-server - Flask App, server side component. It has a simple API that returns a list of possible teammates given username on GitHub.
- teamfinder-react - client side Web app written in React, servers as a frontend to present the data.
  For simplicity of serving static content for the client application, React App build artifacts are copied to static content in the Flask App.
  Each of these subprojects contain their own Readme file.
